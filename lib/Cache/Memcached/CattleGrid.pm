=head1 NAME

Cache::Memcached::CattleGrid - Thundering Herd Protection for Memcached clients

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Cache::Memcached::CattleGrid qw(:all);
  
  my $client = Cache::Memcached::Fast->new(...);
  
  my $value = cache_get_or_compute(
    $client,
    key         => "foo", # key to fetch
    expiration  => 60,    # [s] expiration to set if need to compute the value
    compute_cb  => sub { ... expensive computation... return $result },
  );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a prototype of a Thundering-Herd prevention algorithm for
memcached. As most such systems, it doesn't play entirely nicely
with incompatible modes of access to the same keys, but that's
not so much surprise, one would hope. Access to different keys
in the same memcached instance through different means is perfectly
safe and compatible.

The logic in this module should be compatible with any Memcached
client library that has the same API as the L<Cache::Memcached::Fast>
module at least for the following methods: C<get>, C<set>, C<add>,
C<gets>, C<cas>. It has only been tested with the aforementioned
client library.

=head2 The Problem Statement

The algorithm described and implemented here
attempts to provide means of dealing
with two kinds of situations. Most similar systems appear to be
targeted at the first and more common situation only:

=over 2

=item 1

A hot cached value expires. Between the point in time when it
expired and the time when the first user has recomputed the
value and successfully filled the cache, all users of the cache
will, in a naive cache client implementation, attempt to
recalculate the value to store in the cache. This can bring down
back-end systems that are not designed to handle the load of
all front-ends that rely on the cacheL<[1]|/"Footnotes">.

=item 2

A normal web environment has rather friendly, randomized access
patterns. But if your cache has a number of near-synchronized
clients that all attempt to access a new cache key in unison
(such as when a second or a minute roll around), then some of the
mechanisms that can help in situation 1 break down.

=back

=head2 The Solution

A very effective approach to deal with most causes of situation 1)
is described in L<[2]|/"Footnotes">. In a nutshell, it's a trade-off in that we
accept that for a small amount time, we will serve data from a stale
cache. This small amount of time is the minimum of either: the time it
takes for a single process to regenerate a fresh cache value or
a configured safety threshold. This has the effect that when a cache entry
has expired, the first to request the cache entry will start reprocessing
and all subsequent accesses (until the reprocessing is done) will use
the old, slightly outdated cached data. This is a perfectly valid
strategy in many use cases and where extreme accuracy of the cached
values is required, it's usually possible to address that either by
active invalidation (deleting from memcached) or by simply setting a
more stringent expire time.

That approach does not handle situation 2), in which many clients
attempt to access a cache entry that didn't previously exist. To my knowledge,
there is no generic solution for handling that situation. It will always
require application specific knowledge to handle. For this
situation, there is a configurable back-off time, or a custom hook
interface to intercept such cases and handle them with custom logic.

=head2 The Algorithm

Situation 1 from above is handled by always storing a tuple in the cache
that includes the real, user-supplied expiration time of the cached value.
The expiration time that is set on the cache entry is the sum of the
user-supplied expiration time and an upper-bound estimate of the
time it takes to recalculate the cached value.

On retrieval of the cache entry (tuple), the client checks whether
the real, user-supplied expiration time has passed and if so, it will
recalculate the value. Before doing so, it attempts to obtain a lock
on the cache entry to prevent others from concurrently also
recalculating the same cache entry.

The locking is implemented by setting a flag on the tuple structure
in the cache that indicates that the value is already being reprocessed.
This can be done race-condition free by using the C<add>, C<gets>, and
C<cas> commands supplied by Memcached. With the command that sets
the being-reprocessed flag on a tuple, the client always sets an
expiration time of the upper-bound of the expected calculation time,
thus protecting against indefinitely invalidating the cache
when a re-calculation fails, slows, or locks up.

On retrieval of a cache entry that is being reprocessed, other clients
than the one doing the reprocessing will continue to return the
old cached value. The time this stale value is in use is bounded by
the reprocessing time set as expiration above.

There are a number of conditions under which there is no such stale
value to use, however, including the first-use of the cache entry
and a cache entry that is used rarely enough to expire altogether before
a client finds it to be outdated. The pathological variant is one
in which a large number of clients concurrently request a cache value
that is not available at all (stale or not). In this situation,
the remedy is application dependent. By default, all clients but one
wait for up to the upper-bound on the time it takes to calculate
the cached value. This may result in a slow-down, but no Thundering
Herd effect on back-end systems. If a complete failure to provide the
cached value is preferrable to a slow-down, then that can be achieved
by providing a corresponding custom callback, see below.

=over 2

=item [1]

I am of the firm (and learned) opinion that when you're in such
a situation, your cache is no longer strictly a cache and memcached
is no longer the appropriate technology to use.
